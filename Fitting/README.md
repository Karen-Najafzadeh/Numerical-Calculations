# Curve Fitting
Curve fitting is used when you have a set of data and you want to fit it a mathematical function, so you can predict the behavior of the data and how it would act in other positions that you have no available data there.
<br /> here I have written two programs that can help you fit functions to your data:
* 1 [Least square method](https://github.com/Karen-Najafzadeh/Numerical-Calculations/tree/main/Fitting/Least%20square%20method):
  
  fits the best possible linear mathematical function to your data
* 2 [polynomial fitting](https://github.com/Karen-Najafzadeh/Numerical-Calculations/tree/main/Fitting/polynomial%20fitting):
  
  fits the best possible polynomial mathematical function to your data
