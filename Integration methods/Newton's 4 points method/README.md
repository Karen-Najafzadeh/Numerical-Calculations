# Newton–Cotes quadrature method
Well to be honest this method is quiet a little complicated so I'm not going to explain the mathematics as the goal of this project is just to use the methods to do calculations.
<br />But here you can find and read more about [Newton–Cotes quadrature rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas)

So if we ignore the mathematics, the rest is actually nothing much. just follw the flowchart and you'll be fine.
