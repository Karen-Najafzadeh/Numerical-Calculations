# Numerical Calculations
This repository contains my python programs I wrote as practice for my Numerical Calculations course at Kharazmi University. 

I've tried to understand the algorithm of several famous problems in mathematics and write python programs for each topic I learned in my Numerical calculations course. Eatch folder in this repository is dedicated to one of those topics and contains .py files and enough explanations to understand the code. I've also drew some flowcharts for each problem and tried to explain how my code, and the mathematics work. Hope my work can help you in some way.
