# Root-Finding methods  
One of the most important questions you ask yourself when facing a mathematical function might be that what is/are the root/roots of this function. I found three different methods to find at least one of the roots of a given mathematical function. Naturaly there will be some errors due to the precision and effectiveness of the method so if you encountered any wierd ansewers, it's because the methods are not too accurate.
